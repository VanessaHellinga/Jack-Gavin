        <h2 class="bio-title">Jack Gavin</h2>

        <p class="bio-text">From the rehearsal halls of Kent State University, to stadium performances 
        around the world, to the School of Music at Lipscomb University, Jack Gavin
        has contributed to music across genres, disciplines, and generations.
        <br><br>
        Jack began his studies at Niagara County Community College in Niagara Falls, NY
        then finished at Kent State University in Kent, OH with a Bachelor of Music 
        Performance in 1983. Jack has trained under Cleveland Philharmonic Orchestra 
        Percussionist, Donald Miller; Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra Principle Percussionist, 
        Lynn Harbold; and Tommy Dorsey’s drummer and Buffalo State University professor, 
        Louis Marino. Jack’s innate talent, performance experience, and training in classical 
        and jazz music prepared him for a career that would lead him to philharmonic orchestras, 
        symphonies, and ensembles as well as modern rock, pop, and country.
        <br><br>
        The down beat beginning Jack’s career was with Mel McDaniel, who was the first of many
        world tours for Jack. In 1986 Jack began his career with the legendary Charlie Daniels
        Band. Jack is known for his high-energy performances, and as Charlie’s drummer, Jack 
        shared his talent every night. Jack toured and recorded with Charlie for fourteen 
        years before becoming band leader and drummer for Tracy Lawrence in 1999. In 2003, 
        Jack began working for Tanya Tucker. While working for Tanya Tucker, Jack played 
        drums, recorded albums, was musical director and managed both tour and production. 
        Jack worked for Tanya for ten years.
        <br><br>  
        Jack has performed with a variety of other artists over the years, including: 
        Willie Nelson, Ted Nugent, Travis Tritt, John Kay of Steppenwolf, Colin Raye, 
        Jamie O’Neal, Ronnie Milsap, Pam Tillis and Dolly Parton. It is because of Jack’s 
        talent and work ethic that he has been offered opportunities to perform with such 
        a wide range of artists while endorsing Remo and Regal Tip as well as Zildjian and 
        Gretsch, which he has endorsed for over thirty years.
        <br><br>        
        Currently, Jack manages several up and coming artists and performs as a studio session
        musician. Most recently, Jack has been performing with T. Graham Brown. Jack runs his
        own studio out of his home where he holds rehearsals for the artists he manages.  
        Additionally, Jack shares his passion for music with the next generation at Lipscomb
        University’s School of Music where he is an adjunct professor. Jack, who has been 
        a Gretsch endorser for over thirty years, now represents The Gretsch Company as 
        the Nashville ambassador.
        <br>   
        Whether performing in a live show, managing artists, or teaching young musicians,
        Jack’s love for music reigns. Jack Gavin exemplifies a hardworking, well-rounded 
        talent in the music industry.
